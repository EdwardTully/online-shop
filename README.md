Diving deeper into modern web apps.  Modelling after typical web stores, my goal here is to explore making a web store.  This project uses a
JSON server launched on a localhost.  The excercise will be mostly getting, posting and filter with REST.  Maybe even a shopping cart.

Adding redux and redux toolkit to provide store, late in the game so the file structure will not be opinionated

Trying out Figma and various AI code generators to help design layout and provide ready made framework to my components to reside.

Trying out DataTable from react data table component, will try in the shopping cart.
